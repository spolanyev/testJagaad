    "content": "Portugal's second city after Lisbon, Porto is known as the \"Capital of the North\" or the \"unbeaten city \", because it was never defeated militarily since its creation during the Roman Empire and did not give in to either the Moors or Napoleon\u2019s attacks.A city rich in history and typically Mediterranean, Porto has a strong industrialization and welcomes tourists with its friendly people, its accommodations at great rates, its lively cultural life and its excellent gastronomy, which can be experienced at its best through the famous wine that takes its name from this city.Porto has many monuments, buildings, museums and churches to visit. The Cathedral of Oporto, in Baroque style, is the most important religious building of the city, with a cloister decorated with beautiful tiles. The historical center is the Ribeira district, a Unesco World Heritage Site, with its narrow steep streets that climb the hill which ends overlooking the Douro River.Take a stroll in the elegant Avenue of the Allies. Do not miss a visit to the train station of S\u00e3o Bento, decorated inside with over two thousand colored tiles. Also worth seeing is the Stock Exchange Palace, the Crystal Palace and its beautiful gardens and the House of Music, a large concert hall designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and completed in 2005.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in Amsterdam There\u2019s more to Amsterdam than just the storybook charm of its Golden Age architecture and quaint canals. This pocket-size city likes to think big. Its acclaimed museums hold the world\u2019s largest collection of Van Goghs along with impressive Rembrandts, Vermeers, and modern masters. While its eco-friendly attitude and proud history of embracing diversity has long attracted international attention. With so much going for it, we\u2019ve made it easier for you by sharing our top picks. From the Rijksmuseum\u2019s homegrown collection to Anne Frank\u2019s heart-rending house, discover the best the city has to offer. And don\u2019t forget to soak up some gezellig, the Dutch concept of coziness, at any number of bruin caf\u00e9s. 1. Rijksmuseum Brimming with Dutch masterpieces such as Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch, this museum is a must for art lovers. With over 8000 works on display, it\u2019s impossible to see it all; head to the 2nd-floor Gallery of Honour for Golden Age art if you\u2019re short on time. The intricate Delft pottery is also worth a look. 2. Van Gogh Museum With the world\u2019s largest collection of Van Goghs, there\u2019s no better place to explore the life and works of this troubled genius. Housing a mix of lesser-known drawings and famed paintings, it shows the fascinating transition of Van Gogh\u2019s style, from somber Dutch landscapes to bright, swirling sunflowers. 3. Anne Frank\u2019s story For two terrifying years, Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis in the back of a canal house from 1635. Seeing the airless annex in real life is an unforgettable and emotionally charged experience. A tour can also show you her childhood haunts and the shop where she bought her now-famous diary. 4. Canal tours Floating down its many canals is one of the most atmospheric ways to see the city sights. Extending around 62 miles, these canals are an iconic symbol of Amsterdam, while the picturesque 17th-century ring area is also UNESCO World Heritage Listed. Options range from general tickets to a luxury experience. 5. Bike riding In a country said to have more bikes than people, it\u2019s only natural that the best way to explore the city is by bike. Not only do you get to experience Amsterdam like a local, but with over 320 miles of dedicated lanes it\u2019s also a convenient way to get around. Less confident riders can opt for an easy bike tour. 6. Dutch countrysideCrisscrossed by canals and dotted with windmills, the Dutch countryside is as picturesque as it gets. Take a day trip from Amsterdam and discover the attractions just outside it. Top places to visit include Marken island, with its wooden homes, the windmills of Zaanse Schans, and the flower-filled fields of Keukenhof GardensPlanning your Amsterdam visit When to go? June to August is the peak tourist season which means there will be greater crowds, but you may be willing to brave them for the warm weather (perfect for cycling) and long days. Those wishing to avoid said crowds should come before or after the tourist peak season, between April and May or September and November. Good weather can\u2019t be guaranteed, but it\u2019ll be mild and at least you can enjoy the city at its laid-back best. March to May is also the time to catch those famed tulips in bloom. For those who don\u2019t mind the cold and the short days, winter is an ideal time to nab a deal. Flights and accommodation are likely to be at their lowest. Plus, if the weather ever gets too much for you, you can always warm up in a cozy bruin caf\u00e9. How many days should you spend? This varies a lot depending on your traveling style. If you\u2019re someone who likes an action-packed itinerary, you can see the main sights in two days as it\u2019s a pretty compact city. If instead, you\u2019re someone who likes to take it a bit slower and get into the rhythm of local life, you could take a week or even more. This will give you the time to explore the city on foot or with a bike tour, and let you include day trips to Zaanse Schans to see the windmills or Keukenhof to wander in the tulip fields. How to get there? Schiphol International Airport (also known as Amsterdam Airport) is the Netherlands \u2019 main airport and also one of Europe\u2019s busiest. A convenient 5 miles from Amsterdam, it\u2019s well-connected by trains that depart for Centraal Station around every 10 minutes from 6 am to 1 am; it runs hourly between 2 am and 5 am. The trip takes 15 minutes and tickets cost \u20ac5.50. Otherwise, the Connexxion Airport Express bus gets you to the center in 30 minutes (\u20ac6.50 one way; \u20ac11.25 return). Taxis cost around \u20ac45. How to move around the city? Amsterdam is a compact city, which makes getting around relatively easy. If you\u2019re only going to be exploring the city center, you can get almost everywhere on foot. If you plan on using public transport, we recommend you get a 1- to 7-day GVB pass (available at GVB ticket offices). For most visitors, a combination of walking and taking trams will be all they need. Buses and trains are mainly used to connect to outer suburbs. Most locals get around by bike and if you feel like following their lead the city is well-equipped with bike lanes and rentals. Taxis are readily available, although they tend to be slower because of the maze-like streets. Where to shop? For shopping in the most photogenic of settings, nothing quite beats Negen Straatjes (Nine Streets). These narrow streets connecting the 17th-century canals are filled with historic charm and a mix of quirky vintage stores, hip cafes, trendy boutiques, and art galleries. Otherwise, if you\u2019re looking for something a little bit more laid-back and local then De Pijp is the place for you. It has cool concept stores, local Dutch design, and a fantastic open-air market. Luxury lovers instead will want to strut their stuff down PC Hooftstraat, home to haute-couture brands such as Louis Vuitton, Mulberry, and DKNY. Finally, for antiques and art look no further than Spiegelkwartier, where you can splurge on everything from Delft pottery to 17th-century furniture.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in ParisThe City of Lights needs no introduction. For centuries it\u2019s enthralled visitors and inspired the work of some of the world\u2019s most acclaimed writers and artists, from Victor Hugo to Van Gogh. Iconic monuments, world-class museums, elegant boulevards, and impossibly chic inhabitants are all part of its charm. So where to begin in this impeccable city? From its soaring Eiffel Tower to the boldly modern Centre Pompidou and sculpted Arc de Triomphe, we show you the best the city has to offer. And let\u2019s not forget its glorious gastronomy, from delicate pastries to the humble baguette and creamy cheeses accompanied by earthy local wines. Discover it all and let this mesmerizing city cast its spell on you.1. Eiffel TowerConstructed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair, it\u2019s hard to believe this iconic tower was ever intended to be temporary. Saved by its potential use as a radio antena, it\u2019s become one of Paris\u2019 most enduring symbols. Head to the third floor for city views (that get especially romantic at night).2. Louvre MuseumThere\u2019s more to the Louvre than its gleaming glass pyramid and Da Vinci\u2019s mysterious Mona Lisa. Home to more than 10,000 works, its collection runs the gamut from Egyptian antiques to Dutch masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt. Highlights include the ancient Winged Victory of Samothrace and Venus de Milo.3. Arc de TriompheBegun in 1806 in honor of Napol\u00e9on\u2019s recent victory at Austerlitz, it was another 20 years before his monumental arch was finally complete. Highlights include intricate sculptures such as D\u00e9part des Volontaires de 1792 (Departure of the Volunteers of 1792). You can also climb the 284 steps for sweeping views.4. Musee RodinGet to know this famed sculptor in the 18th-century mansion he used to call home. While many of his works are in the mansion itself, his most famous sculptures can be found in the surrounding rose garden. Exuding tranquility, the latter is the perfect place to ponder one of his greatest works: The Thinker.5. Centre PompidouFormer French president George Pompidou wanted a game-changing museum and he certainly got it. Famed for Its radical inside-out architecture, the museum houses cutting-edge exhibitions, performances, cinemas and an enviable permanent collection of French art. Don\u2019t miss the panoramic view from the rooftop.6. French gastronomyHome to one of the world\u2019s most renowned cuisines, there\u2019s no excuse for not indulging in some fantastic foods, such as a light-as-air macaroon or some creamy camembert. Make your way from artisanal boulangeries to exquisite patisseries, cosy bistros and Michelin-star restaurants; you won\u2019t be disappointed.Planning your Paris visitWhen to go?Paris will charm you regardless of the season. That said, the months from April to May and September to October are widely considered the best times to visit. You\u2019ll miss the summer crowds while also getting to enjoy the mild yet sunny weather. Spring also lets you see the city in full bloom. Summer is the peak tourist season (June to August), when the weather is at its best and brightest and attractions are at their busiest. Some local establishments may also close during August. Winter is better for those looking to nab a deal as prices for both flights and accommodation tend to drop. Sights are less packed, although you\u2019ll never have them to yourself as Paris attracts tourists all year round.How many days should you spend?Paris is a cosmopolitan city brimming with culture, history, shopping and fantastic nightlife. Three days might just be enough to pack in some of its main sights, but keep in mind you\u2019d be on a tight schedule. Instead, we recommend you get to know the city at a more leisurely pace by spending five days to a week. This way you can see the city\u2019s top attractions while also discovering its more hidden local side.How to get there?Charles de Gaulle is the city\u2019s main airport and is connected to central Paris by train (RER) and bus; prices range from \u20ac6 to \u20ac18. If you're in a hurry a taxi is the fastest way to get into town (45 minutes) and costs \u20ac55-60.Orly Airport is 13km south of Paris. Getting to the city center is a little less direct unless you take a taxi (\u20ac35). If you go by train, you\u2019ll have to change at the Antony station to lines RER B or RER C. It costs around \u20ac12 one way. Otherwise, the Orlybus will take you direct for \u20ac8.30 one way.Beauvais Airport is a small airport 80 km from Paris, which is mostly used by low-cost airlines. It takes 80 minutes approximately by airport shuttle to Porte Maillot (\u20ac17). Trains run to Gare du Nord station every 1 to 2 hours and cost \u20ac13-\u20ac16.How to move around the city?While the city is by no means small, it\u2019s relatively easy getting around thanks to a speedy and efficient public transport system. The Metro and RER are the fastest modes of transport and operate from around 5:30 am to 1:15 am (Fridays and Saturdays the Metro stays open an hour later). There\u2019s also a bus system run by RATP, which may be more convenient for families with strollers and those with limited mobility. Prices start from \u20ac1.90 for a single bus\/train ticket. Paris is also becoming increasingly bike-friendly and this is a scenic way to explore the city. While you\u2019ll spot various bike-share systems throughout the city such as V\u00e9lib', not all will accept foreign credit cards.Where to shop?With its well-heeled locals and chic boutiques, this is a city that knows a thing or two about style. Get your sartorial dose at any number of shopping districts. The Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 is the beating heart of designer fashion, with flagships stores from big-name brands such as Versace and Hermes. Otherwise, if you\u2019re looking for something more niche head to Marais, which has everything from artisanal jewelers to trendy concept stores like Merci. Vintage lovers will go wild in Paris\u2019 many flea markets; Saint-Ouen is the city\u2019s largest and is a veritable treasure trove of pre-loved goods. Additionally, you can\u2019t leave Paris without strolling through one of its covered arcades famed for their old-world beauty, such as the Galerie Vivienne.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in RomeA modern-day city steeped in history, Rome is an endless feast of art and culture. Italy\u2019s capital and the first great metropolis of humanity, the city shows off three millennia of history in architectural and artistic treasures that will quite simply leave you breathless. You\u2019ll never see it all, they say one lifetime is not long enough to see all Rome has to offer. But with our top picks you can see the city\u2019s very best. Glimpse the city\u2019s golden age with the Colosseum, Roman Forum and the Pantheon, or marvel at the might of the Catholic Church inside the stunning St Peter\u2019s Basilica. Immerse yourself in the city\u2019s timeless beauty, and don\u2019t forget to lose yourself in the dolce vita lifestyle.1. ColosseumOpened in AD 80, this 50,000-seat gladiatorial arena is arguably Rome\u2019s most spectacular sight. An iconic symbol of Imperial Rome, its inauguration was marked by games said to have lasted 100 days and nights, which led to the slaughter of 5000 animals. Its end was signaled by the fall of the Roman Empire.2. PantheonGaze in awe at this former Roman temple to the gods. Completed around AD 126, almost 500 years later it found new life as a Christian church. One of the best-preserved buildings from this era, mostly due to its continued use, walking beneath its granite columns and ingenious dome is an enthralling experience.3. Vatican MuseumsDiscover one of the world\u2019s most impressive art collections, amassed throughout the centuries by the Roman Catholic Church. From Michelangelo\u2019s breathtaking Sistine Chapel to Raphael\u2019s masterly frescoes and more than 70,000 other exhibits, you\u2019ll need to pace yourself for this heady art immersion.4. St Peter\u2019s BasilicaThe holiest of catholic shrines, unparalleled both in size, beauty and riches, St Peter\u2019s Basilica is the one cathedral you don\u2019t want to miss. Highlights include the many artistic treasures found inside, such as Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0, along with the immense dome and towering bronze baldachin by Bernini.5. Galleria BorgheseThanks to the scheming (and thieving!) by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, this is one of the best private art collections around. Not only featuring sensational works by Caravaggio, Raphael, Titian and Bernini, the villa is also a sumptuous backdrop to the masterpieces. Admission by reservation only.6. Roman ForumThese sprawling ruins were at the center of daily life in ancient Rome. Formerly filled with extravagant temples, government buildings and shops, wandering through lonely columns and stone fragments lets you reimagine its past grandeur. Top sights include the Temple of Saturn, Arch of Titus and the Curia.Planning your Rome visitWhen to go?Rome is sure to charm you all year round. That said, summer is its busiest period, in which case you might want to choose another time to avoid the crowds. It also tends to get quite hot and humid in the July and August months. Many prefer April to May or September to November, when the weather is sunny but cool and attractions are less packed. While winter is less popular, it\u2019s still an ideal time to visit; prices are lower as it\u2019s off peak, picturesque Christmas markets pop up everywhere, and there's also the unique opportunity to attend the Vatican\u2019s Midnight Mass.How to get there?The Leonardo da Vinci airport in Fiumicino is Rome\u2019s main international airport. The quickest way of getting to the center is by taking the Leonardo Da Vinci express (\u20ac14 one way), which takes just over 30 minutes. Instead, a taxi will cost \u20ac48 fixed fare. The Ciampino airport is smaller and is largely used by budget airlines. It\u2019s slightly closer to central Rome. From here, public buses and trains run regularly to the Termini station and take around 50 to 60 minutes. Airport shuttles are also available (\u20ac6 one way), while taxis will set you back around \u20ac35.How many days should you spend?As it\u2019s been famously said, there are more treasures in Rome than can be seen in one lifetime. A weekend will be enough to cover its main attractions, including the Colosseum and the Pantheon, but you could spend an infinite amount of time exploring its many ancient attractions and artistic masterpieces. And let's not forget the many pleasures of its languid lifestyle. Wander idly down picturesque alleys, enjoy people-watching in any number of scenic piazzas, feast on the city's spectacularly hearty cuisine and watch the time fly as you soak up that dolce vita.How to move around the city?Getting around Rome isn\u2019t always easy. This is partly because of the many ruins buried under the city, which are often discovered when extending public transport lines. Not only do they delay construction, they also have to be circumvented, leading to longer and less direct routes. The metro is the quickest mode of transport but its network is limited. There are two main lines that service the centre: A (orange) and B (blue). Buses run by the ATAC also operate frequently; their main hub is in front of Termini station. Taxis are not that easy to hail and it's best to look for them at ranks or simply phone for one. If you\u2019re looking to explore just the city center, we\u2019d suggest you go on foot, which also lets you experience the ancient atmosphere up close.Where to shop?From designer flagships to independent boutiques and vintage troves, Rome has something to suit all tastes. Fashionistas flock to the fancy streets around the Spanish Steps, for their Gucci accessories and to nab themselves a Fendi purse. Otherwise, if that\u2019s not your style, the charming Trastevere area has one-of-a-kind stores selling everything from antiques to perfume. Simply hit the shops between Via Garibaldi and Viale Trastevere. Instead vintage aficionados should head to Via del Governo Vecchio, which winds its way through the Centro Storico. Finally, if you\u2019re looking for a more local experience Monti is for you; it\u2019s the place to shop for up-and-coming Italian designers. Begin your browsing around Via del Boschetto and Via Panisperna.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in MilanFashion paradise, design haven and the epitome of old-school elegance, Milan is a city with many faces. And discovering them is all part of its charm. Known for seamlessly combining both the historic and the on-trend, it\u2019s a place where haughty couture and chic dining goes hand-in-hand with magnificent palazzos, ancient churches and early Renaissance art. With so much to dazzle you, we\u2019ve made it easier by selecting some of our all-time favorites. From gazing awe-struck at Da Vinci\u2019s magnificent Last Supper, to admiring the Old Masters at the Pinacoteca or enjoying a night at the city\u2019s world-famous opera house, we show you how to make the most of your trip to one of Italy\u2019s most cosmopolitan cities.1. The Last Supper Nothing compares to seeing one of Da Vinci\u2019s greatest works in the flesh (so to speak). Faded and fragile, partly due to Da Vinci experimenting with an unusual mix of oil and tempera, it\u2019s still a staggering work. Not least because of its striking composition and perspective, light years ahead of its time.2. The Duomo Six hundred years in the making, this epic white-marbled cathedral is not to be missed. Brimming with over a hundred spires and 3400 statues, it\u2019s the city\u2019s most elaborate symbol. Equally impressive is the interior with its enormous stained glass windows, while the rooftop offers spectacular views.3. PinacotecaImmerse yourself in the Old Masters, such as Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese to name a few. Our top highlights include Mantegna\u2019s Lamentation over the Dead Christ with its fantastic perspective and brutal realism, along with The Kiss by Francesco Hayez, a passionate symbol of Italy\u2019s unification.4. Galleria Vittorio Emanuele IIWith its glorious high arches of glass and steel, and marbled mosaic floors, the Galleria makes for an atmospheric stroll at any time of day. One of the world\u2019s oldest shopping arcades, it\u2019s also an ideal stop for high-end boutiques, with plenty of fancy dining options if you happen to get hungry.5. La ScalaA night at the opera reaches new heights when it\u2019s at La Scala. One of the world\u2019s famed opera houses, its stage has been graced by the likes of Maria Callas while Verdi built his impressive reputation here. For non-opera fans, there\u2019s also ballet and classical music performances, along with theater tours.6. Da Vinci\u2019s VineyardMany don\u2019t know that while Da Vinci was painting the Last Supper, he was also tending to his nearby vineyard. Gifted to him by Duke Ludovico Sforza in 1498, it\u2019s since been painstakingly recreated so not only can you saunter through the vines as Da Vinci might have done, you can also sip the same wine.Planning your Milan visitWhen to go?Milan is always a good idea, regardless of the month or season. In spring the weather is sunny and mild, while the city buzzes with international events such as Salone del Mobile and Fashion Week. Summer is also popular although it tends to get hot and humid, and the mosquitoes come out in droves. Locals flee the city, especially on the weekends, so it can be nice because the city feels a little less packed. Keep in mind though that come August and shops and restaurants outside of the center are likely to be closed or have summer trading hours. Autumn is ideal for the moderate weather and fewer tourists, while during the winter months you\u2019ll get to enjoy the Christmas markets, opera season at La Scala and January sales.How to get there?The city is serviced by three airports. The Malpensa Airport is the main airport for international flights. From here to the city center it's a 50-minute shuttle bus or train ride (via the Malpensa Express; \u20ac13 one way). By taxi it will cost \u20ac90 fixed fare. The Linate airport is more centrally located and serves mainly domestic flights and those from within the EU. Coaches or public buses (No. 73) are a 30-minute ride to the center, while taxis cost around \u20ac20 to \u20ac30. The Bergamo airport (Orio al Serio) is used mostly by budget airlines and is a 1-hour bus ride (\u20ac8 one way) from central Milan.How many days should you spend?Milan is a city that can be explored over both a weekend, a week, or even a month. In 48 hours you\u2019ll be able to experience all its main sights, from Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper to a night at La Scala, but keep in mind you\u2019ll have to plan in advance for most tickets. Instead, if you want to really immerse yourself in the city, we recommend you taking a little more time. Not only will you be able to shop the world-famed Quadrilatero d\u2019Oro and wander the picturesque Navigli (canals), this will also give you time to get into the rhythm of the city and enjoy local delights, like a classic aperitivo.How to move around the city?The ATM runs the metro, bus and tram services. You\u2019ll be able to get to most places via the metro, which has four underground lines (a fifth is projected for the near future): red M1, green M2, yellow M3, and lilac M5. There\u2019s also the suburban rail network (the Passante Ferroviario), although it runs much less frequently. A single ticket costs \u20ac2; it\u2019s valid either for one metro ride or 90 minutes of travel on buses and trams. Other ticket options include a 10-trip carnet (\u20ac18) or 3-day ticket (\u20ac12).Where to shop?Milan is renowned for shopping and there\u2019s no shortage of high-end boutiques and classy consumer goods to swoon over. The Quadrilatero d\u2019Oro is the city\u2019s acclaimed shopping district. Framed by four streets - Via Monte Napoleone, Via Sant'Andrea, Via Senato and Via Manzoni - within is a back-to-back line-up of stores by fashion power brands, such as Gucci, Versace, Prada etc. You\u2019ll find many of the same brands in the city\u2019s main shopping center, Rinascente, right next to the Duomo. Otherwise, if you\u2019re looking for something a little less glam, Via Torino has more mainstream brands such as H&M and Zara. Those interested in vintage and alternative clothing need look no further than the hip Ticinese area.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in Barcelona This sun-blessed city tops everyone\u2019s destination list, whether it\u2019s for the storybook architecture, glorious food, or simply the lure of a city that\u2019s like a massive beach town. It hits that sweet spot where history and hedonism meet. By day marvel at architectural gems that go from towering Roman-era columns to Gaud\u00ed\u2019s masterpieces. By night feast on tasty tapas before hopping to numerous bars and clubs that only get started around 2 am. Best of all, whenever you need a nature break, the beach is right there and waiting. With so much on offer, we make it easier by sharing our top picks. From Gaud\u00ed\u2019s spectacular unfinished Sagrada Familia to a museum dedicated to Picasso, we show you the best on offer. 1. Sagrada Familia No visit to Barcelona is complete without visiting Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most staggering work. Started in 1812, the sheer magnitude of this project means its construction has continued into the present. Love or hate this twisting turreted masterpiece, there\u2019s nothing quite like it. Head to the Bell Tower for charming views. 2. Casa Batll\u00f3 With its swirling facade that resembles boney gaping mouths, the Casa Batll\u00f3 looks like something out of a dream. Commissioned as a home for the well-to-do Battl\u00f2 family, Gaud\u00ed was given full creative power to create a house like no other. He succeeded; this is Gaud\u00ed at his most mind-blowing and surreal. 3. Picasso Museum Focusing mainly on Picasso\u2019s early formative years, many of which were spent in Barcelona, there\u2019s plenty to enthrall even moderate fans of the artist\u2019s works. With over 3500 pieces, the breadth and versatility of his pieces will impress upon you his undeniable genius, evident even at the tender age of 15. 4. Park G\u00fcell This UNESCO-listed park was originally meant to be a network of houses and landscapes for the rich. Before the project commercially flopped and was finally abandoned, Gaud\u00ed created the enchanting park we know today. Explore 2 miles of winding pathways, grottoes, and mosaicked galleries in Gaud\u00ed\u2019s inimitable style. 5. Montju\u00efc This hilltop overlooking the port is not only packed with lush lawns and tranquil gardens but also top-notch museums, architectural gems, a castle, and an Olympic pool. The Joan Mir\u00f3 museum, in particular, is well worth a visit. This is also the perfect place to escape the crowds and enjoy fantastic city views. 6. La Pedrera Named for its grey stone facade, La Pedrera (the Quarry) was commissioned as an apartment and office block in 1906. Now it\u2019s recognized as a UNESCO-listed masterpiece in Gaud\u00ed\u2019s trademark style. Admire the smoothly curving walls and twisting wrought iron that add a sense of movement and life to the building. Planning your Barcelona visit When to go? Boasting sunny days and moderate weather all year round, there\u2019s no bad time to visit this charming city. July and August is the peak time for tourists, so you can expect accommodation prices to go up and queues for attractions to get long. The weather will also be sweltering hot, and many small businesses will close as locals go on vacation. On the other hand, this is the perfect time to hit the many beaches and the city will be buzzing with a whole host of fun festivals, which include everything from international music to cultural events. If you\u2019re looking for less crowds and milder weather, then spring and autumn are ideal. Winter also has its own appeal; the weather is crisp but not freezing and you\u2019ll still enjoy some sunny days. How many days should you spend? In three to four days, you\u2019ll be able to see Barcelona\u2019s main attractions, but if you really want to get into the flow of city life then we recommend staying for seven days or more. It\u2019ll give you the chance to not only see lesser-known gems such as Montserrat, but also enjoy local activities, such as a picnic on Montju\u00efc, a bike ride along Barceloneta, or a friendly language exchange. It\u2019ll also give you time to feast on all kinds of tasty tapas and explore the non-stop nightlife scene. How to get there? El Prat is the only airport in the city and is the main international airport. Aerob\u00fases run regularly (from 5 am to 1 am) to the center and take around 30 minutes; one-way tickets cost (\u20ac5.90). A taxi costs around \u20ac25. Outside of Barcelona there are two smaller airports: Girona-Costa Brava and Reus. They service mainly low-cost airlines. From Girona airport, there is a direct bus to the Estaci\u00f3 del Nord station in Barcelona. It takes around 75 minutes; tickets cost \u20ac16. From Reus airport, the most direct way to get to Barcelona is by bus, which will take you to Estaci\u00f3 d'Autobusos de Sants. Tickets cost around \u20ac15.50 one-way, and it takes around 90 minutes. How to move around the city? Barcelona offers plenty of transport options that\u2019ll get you around town easily and efficiently. The Metro system is excellent and for the most part, all you\u2019ll need. It runs from 5 am to midnight most nights and then till 2 am on Fridays and 24 hours on Saturdays. There\u2019s also a large network of trams and buses. Single tickets for all main public transport cost \u20ac2.20, in which case a 10-trip ticket (\u20ac11.35) is a good deal if you\u2019re staying for a few days. If you\u2019re up for a spot of exercise, Barcelona is an excellent city for bike riding. The weather is ideal and there are many dedicated bike lanes. Otherwise, it\u2019s relatively easy to get around on foot, especially if you\u2019re in the historic center, while taxis are quite affordable compared to other major European cities. Where to shop? Whether you\u2019re looking for high-end boutiques, historic markets, vintage treasure troves, or hip local design shops, the city more than provides. Top of the list is the city\u2019s main market; La Boqueria. Immerse yourself in its kaleidoscope of colors, sounds, and wondrously enticing scents, as you sample all kinds of fresh foods and Spanish snacks. The elegant Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia instead is worth a visit for power fashion brands, such as Stella McCartney and Louis Vuitton, and also to take in some gorgeous modernist buildings. If you\u2019re looking for something more distinctly local, El Born is where you\u2019ll find home-grown designer boutiques. Finally, El Raval is the place for eclectic design and those hard-to-find vintage gems.",

New York\u2019s history, cuisine, fashion, art, and music have all been nuanced by decades of immigration. So, we\u2019ve made it easier for you by sharing our top picks. From the skyscrapers to world-renowned art museums and the bright lights of Broadway, the Big Apple offers infinite things to see and do. Top 6 things to do in New York City1. Times Square The beating heart of Manhattan, Times Square is one of New York\u2019s most emblematic landmarks. See street performers entertain crowds under the fast-flickering neon lights and bright billboards, go shopping, take selfies or simply watch the world go by from the iconic red steps. Known as \u2018The Crossroads of the World\u2019, Times Square is bang in the middle of the Theater District. From long-running classics to modern musicals, seeing a Broadway show is one of the top things to do in New York. 2. Observation Decks Admiring New York City from above is a one-of-a-kind experience. Perched atop towering skyscrapers, the view from one of the city\u2019s observation decks is always breathtaking. Whether you visit the Empire State Building, the Top of the Rock, or The One Vanderbilt SUMMIT in Midtown, the One World Observatory in downtown, or The Edge\u2019s 100th floor observation deck in Hudson Yards, you\u2019re guaranteed a sight to behold. If you really want to go all out, then book a helicopter ride for an incomparable vantage point. For something more grounded, head to one of the city\u2019s rooftop bars. 3. Museums Home to two of the world\u2019s top museums, New York has so much art and culture on display that it would be impossible to cover everything in one trip. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, known as The Met, is a good place to start and houses more than two million pieces of art. Another firm favorite is The Museum of Modern Art, known as the MoMA, which houses a world-class collection of paintings, sculptures, and designs. The American Museum of Natural History is a great choice for families and explores the natural wonders of the world. Or visit the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum, which remembers and honors the victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers. 4. Central Park A trip to New York City isn\u2019t complete without visiting Central Park. Escape the city to this urban oasis and see how many landmarks you\u2019ve seen in movies you can spot. Wander around its green meadows, gardens, fountains, ponds, and bridges. Rent a bike to cruise around, visit the Central Park Zoo, admire the view from Belvedere Castle, or join a walking tour to discover John Lennon\u2019s Strawberry Fields, the Bethesda Fountain, Conservatory Garden and much more. 5. Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty requires a bit of effort to visit but it\u2019s more than worth it. A gift from France, it\u2019s probably the most famous statue in the world and is undoubtedly New York\u2019s most iconic sight. Representing the freedom and democracy of the United States, it has been standing on Liberty Island since 1886. A 10-to-15-minute ferry ride brings you from Lower Manhattan to the island. While you\u2019re there, don\u2019t miss nearby Ellis Island and its impressive Immigration Museum. 6. Food The melting pot of New York City boasts one of the world\u2019s most diverse culinary scenes. Explore the different flavors and cuisines by joining a gastronomic tour. If you\u2019re looking for authentic Italian food, then head to Arthur Avenue in the Bronx for all the dreamy Italian delicacies you can think of. A foodie tour of the Lower East Side will have you trying mouth-watering specialties such as lox, pastrami, knishes, and pickles from authentic Jewish delis and bakeries. Take a pizza tour to discover your favorite NY slice or head to Chinatown for spicy Asian fare.",

Located on the Garonne River in southwestern France, Bordeaux is known for being the country's most prominent wine region and is the center of wine-growing and producing. The city was introduced to wine during the mid -first century when Bordeaux was under rule of the Romans. From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished following the marriage of Duchess Eleonore of Aquittance to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, who later became King Henry II of England. After being granted a tax-free trade status with England, many locals benefitted from this and were able to increase their profits trading wine.Bordeaux is also known for its high-spirited university-student population that makes it one of the most vibrant and dynamic cities of France. Called \"La perle d'Aquitaine\" (The Pearl of Aquitaine) and \"La Belle Endormie\" (Sleeping Beauty), Bordeaux barely sleeps offering a smooth lifestyle and an awesome setting. Many festivals are held throughout the year including the Bordeaux river festival and Vinexpo, the world's main wine festival.Half of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, boulevards became pedestrian-friendly and neoclassical architecture has been restored. Add some world-class architectural buildings, a water-mirror, an exceptional dining scene, an escapade in vineyards and you've almost reached paradise.

    "content": "Top 5 things to do in VeniceVenice is unlike any other place in the world. A city floating on a lagoon, its shimmering canals, glorious marbled palaces and resplendent churches packed with artistic masterpieces will simply take your breath away. Relatively untouched since its glory days as a financial center and maritime power in the 14th century, wandering down an empty street at night is like stepping back in time. For those not sure where to start their exploration of this fairytale-like city, we\u2019ve got you covered. From the awe-inspiring Doge\u2019s Palace to the exquisitely mosaicked Basilica di San Marco, lulling gondola rides and feasts of cicchetti (delicious small local dishes), we show you the best the city has to offer.1. Doge\u2019s PalaceThe seat of Venetian political power, this waterfront palace is a Gothic masterpiece in white stone and pink marble. It served as both the residence of the Doge and the administrative center. Highlights include lavish council rooms, Tintoretto\u2019s swirling Paradise and a 24-carat gilded stucco staircase.2. St Mark\u2019s SquareThis historic square captures the wealth, beauty and architectural splendor of Venice\u2019s past. Admire famed buildings such as the Basilica di San Marco with its intricate mosaics and marble, along with the arcaded Procuratie Vecchie and Procuratie Nuove. Arrive very early or very late to escape the crowds.3. Gondola rideA gondola ride along the picturesque canals will give you a stunning vantage point on the city. Formerly a mode of transport for the Venetian upper class, now you too can glide down the main canal and hidden waterways (many of which can\u2019t be accessed by foot), while soaking in the unique atmosphere of Venice.4. Cicchetti (local snacks)Don\u2019t leave Venice without stepping into a bacaro (wine bar) and indulging in some cicchetti, the city\u2019s most famous snack. Like the Venetian version of tapas, these are small dishes to be enjoyed at the bar with a glass of ombra (wine), and include everything from polpette (meatballs) to open sandwiches.5. La FeniceOpened in 1792, La Fenice has a long and intriguing history. Not only was it mysteriously set ablaze more than once, but it also premiered the works of several renowned composers, from Verdi to Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. Discover its magic over a heart-rending opera or glimpse its inner workings on a tour.6. Burano and MuranoThere\u2019s more to the lagoon than just Venice. Of the dozen or so inhabited islands, two that are well worth an excursion are Burano and Murano. Each has its own special character. Burano is famed for its pastel-colored canal-side houses while Murano-made glassware has been highly prized since the Middle Ages.Planning your Venice visitWhen to go?Venice\u2019s timeless beauty can be enjoyed all through the year, depending on what you\u2019re looking for. Get a jump on those off-season crowds by coming in spring, but keep in mind the tradeoff will be the certainty of good weather. Summer instead is the city\u2019s peak season and guarantees warm weather, along with higher rates and bigger crowds. September to November is best for those looking to see the city without so many tourists, although you\u2019ll have to watch out for the acqua alta (high tide). Winter gets quite chilly, sights tend to close earlier but it also can be blissfully quiet. That is, except when Carnival comes round, the tourists stream in and the whole city celebrates.How many days should you spend?Around three days will be enough to see all the city\u2019s main attractions and also include some of the neighboring islands, such as Murano or Burano. That said, if you\u2019re looking to enjoy a more local experience, four to five days will give you the chance to wander down some hidden lanes, feast on seafood and soak up the gentle pace of life.How to get there?The closest airport is named after the famed Venetian explorer, Marco Polo. From there it\u2019s a scenic ride by water taxi (from \u20ac110) or water shuttle (\u20ac22) to central Venice. You can also get there by bus, which is the fastest (20 minutes) and cheapest (\u20ac8) option. By taxi it costs around \u20ac40. Otherwise you can also fly into Treviso airport, which is used mostly by low-budget airlines. Situated to the north of Venice, it\u2019s an hour-long bus ride (\u20ac12 one way) to Piazzale Roma. Taxis cost \u20ac80.How to move around the city?It may seem daunting at first getting around this city of winding streets, bridges and canals, but it\u2019s relatively easy once you get the hang of it. Vaporetti are the small passenger ferries that are the city\u2019s main form of public transport. A single ride costs \u20ac7.50. If you\u2019re staying for longer or are planning on moving around a lot it might be worth your while investing in a pass; options go from one to seven days and cost \u20ac20-60. The ACTV also runs buses that run on the mainland and in Lido. Gondola rides instead are quite pricey (from \u20ac80) and are more of an \u2018experience\u2019 than a form of transport.Where to shop?Escape the many souvenir shops and you\u2019ll find that while Venice is by no means one of Italy\u2019s shopping mecca\u2019s, it still manages to hold its own. T Fondaco dei Tedeschi by DFS is its most recently hyped locale. A shopping center in a historic building from the 1500s, the building alone is worth a visit, while sweeping views can be enjoyed from the roof. Le Mercerie instead is the city\u2019s classic shopping destination, made up of a warren\u2019s den of streets boasting mostly luxury brands. On Salizada San Mois\u00e8, you\u2019ll also find high-end brands, many of which hail from Italy, such as Versace, Miu Miu and Etro. Those looking for something a bit more niche will enjoy exploring the San Samuele area, with its galleries, craft and textile stores and independent boutiques.",

Built on seven hills and overlooking the Tagus River and the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon welcomes its many visitors with the warmth of its people and the quality of its dishes, especially seafood. Characteristic of its steep neighborhoods are the low-rise buildings in pastel shades, alternating with bell towers and domes. The heart of the old town is the flat Baixa district. Perched on the highest hill of the city there is Saint George's Castle, built by the Visigoths in the fifth century and later converted into a royal residence by the Moors. Nearby there is the small medieval district of Santa Cruz, the oldest and most picturesque village of Lisbon.

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in LondonLife moves fast in this sprawling cosmopolitan city. Famed for its diversity, it\u2019s a melting pot of cultures and a hotbed of progressive art, fashion, and music. That said, it\u2019s equally well known for its long and fascinating past that stretches back almost two millennia. This is a place where innovation and the ancient go hand in hand, where you can admire both the historic Tower of London and the modern Shard, or the celebrated British museum and an avantgarde installation. The choices are endless. We make it easier by sharing our top picks with you. From the magnificent Buckingham Palace to an enviable array of world-class museums and a giant wheel with jaw-dropping views, discover the city\u2019s best. 1. Tower of London Dating back to 1066, the Tower of London lets you glimpse the city\u2019s grisly yet captivating past. The former royal residence also served as an armory, treasury, mint, zoo, and most famously a high-ranking prison where royalty and nobles met their tragic ends. You can also admire the glittering Crown Jewels. 2. Buckingham Palace No trip to London is complete without seeing the Buckingham Palace, symbol of the British monarchy and the official royal residence since 1837. While you can admire it from afar, nothing compares to standing before the grandeur of rooms such as the red-carpeted Grand Hall with its glittering chandeliers. 3. London Eye The world\u2019s largest cantilevered observation wheel, the London Eye takes you a dizzying 135m up high. On a clear day, views stretch as far as 25 miles, giving you a birds-eye vantage point on the city\u2019s famed landmarks. It\u2019s a slow 30-minute ride that\u2019s so smooth, it\u2019s easy to forget just how high up you are. 4. British Museum Opened in 1759, the British Museum is one of the world\u2019s oldest and greatest museums, with an awe-inspiring collection of art and artifacts over two million years of human history. From the Rosetta Stone, key to decoding hieroglyphics, to the disputed Elgin Marbles, a visit here is an eye-opening experience. 5. Westminster Abbey If only these walls could speak. Since 960 AD Westminster Abbey has held (almost) every monarch\u2019s coronation since William the Conqueror, 16 royal weddings, and is the resting place of 3300 prominent people in British history, from poets to politicians. It\u2019s also famed for its early English Gothic architecture. 6. National Gallery You could easily spend a day immersed in this collection of European masters with more than 2300 works. Covering the mid-13th century to the 1900s, it has paintings by acclaimed artists ranging from Da Vinci to Van Gogh, Picasso, and Turner. While temporary exhibitions aren\u2019t free, they\u2019re also worth a look. Planning your London visit When to go? London is a bustling megacity that never stops, regardless of the time of year. An action-packed calendar of events, from festivals to live music and theatre performances, takes place all year round. That said, summer is the most popular season for visitors, when the weather gets warm, and the days get long. The downside is you\u2019ll have to endure queues for most attractions, while accommodation prices also rise. Christmas and bank holidays are similarly busy. Spring and autumn are better seasons if you\u2019re looking to avoid the crowds and still enjoy some nicer weather; you may want to pack an umbrella though as it tends to rain. Those who aren\u2019t put off by a bit of cold weather and shorter days will enjoy the calmer winter months of January and February. How many days should you spend? London is the kind of city you can spend anywhere from a day to a week, depending on what you want to get out of your trip and how packed you like your schedule to be. It\u2019s impossible to see everything so it\u2019s best to prioritize and plan in advance. For first-time visitors, three to four days is enough to give you a taste of the city and see some of its main attractions. Keep in mind it\u2019s an enormous city so distances between landmarks can be great; you\u2019ll need to factor this into your plans. Otherwise, five to seven days will allow you to go at a slower pace and include more local experiences, like going to the pub, seeing a play in the West End and strolling through one of its many gorgeous parks. How to get there? Heathrow is the main airport and it\u2019s well connected to central London by bus, the Overground, Heathrow Express and the Tube, which all run from around 5 am to midnight. Night buses are also available, while the Tube runs 24\/7 on Friday and Saturday. Tickets cost \u00a35.10-34; taxis costs \u00a350-90. City Airport is closest to central London and is connected by DLR (one way \u00a32.80-5). Taxis cost \u00a325-50. Gatwick is connected by the Gatwick Express that runs direct to Victoria (\u00a331.05). Budget options such as coach (from \u00a34) or bus (\u00a311-20) are also available. Taxis cost around \u00a3100. Stansted is connected by the Stansted Express (\u00a319.40) and 24\/7 by coach (\u00a38-13). Taxis cost around \u00a3100. Luton is accessible by coach 24\/7; tickets from \u00a35. Trains cost \u00a317.70; taxis charge \u00a350-80. How to move around the city? London is fairly easy to navigate with an extensive transport system that includes: the Tube (one of the fastest modes of transport), the Overground and the DLR, and buses. Using an Oyster card is the cheapest way to get around. On the other end of the scale, you have taxis, which are convenient but pricey (especially the Black Cabs). The city also has a bike-share program that\u2019s handy if you\u2019re a confident city rider. These are designed for short trips, so if you\u2019re interested in doing a longer journey it\u2019s better to rent a bike elsewhere for the day. If you\u2019re looking for a more scenic way to get around, there are also boat rides along the Thames. Where to shop? London is a paradise without peer for shoppers. If you have the time and money, choices are literally limitless. Oxford is the most famous (and also busiest) of the city\u2019s shopping streets. It\u2019s home to commercial brands such as Adidas and Zara, and a handful of established department stores. Nearby Regent St offers more upscale brands, such as Calvin Klein and Barbour. Covent Garden is also popular, but has a more diverse mix of stores, with luxury brands such as Tom Ford and one-of-a-kind gems such as the Petersham Nurseries and the eclectic Neal\u2019s Yard. Creative types will want to go to Shoreditch, where chic buys from Redchurch Street can be paired with vintage picks from Brick Lane. Finally, Mayfair is the place for haute couture, luxury brands and bespoke suits.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in Madrid Get caught up in the boundless energy of this magnetic city. Its nightlife is the stuff of legends while its gastronomy is off the charts. Thanks to centuries of art-loving Spanish royals, it also houses several world-class museums with impeccable collections. And while it may not have Barcelona\u2019s famed modernist attractions, it makes up for it with eye-catching architecture that runs the gamut from gracious Belle \u00c9poque buildings to Mud\u00e9jar Revival churches and medieval mansions. So where to begin when there\u2019s so much on offer? We make it easier with a list of our top picks. From admiring home-grown talents Goya and Vel\u00e1zquez at the Prado to feasting on fantastic tapas, we show you the city\u2019s best. 1. Museo del Prado Delve into the works of some of Spain\u2019s greatest artists in this world-class museum. Goya, Vel\u00e1zquez and El Greco are all generously represented and offer a window into the country\u2019s past. The museum also has an impressive collection of Flemish, Dutch and Italian art, acquired during the Spanish Empire. 2. Reina Sof\u00eda Museum Not just home to Picasso\u2019s famed Guernica, this museum also has an outstanding collection of contemporary art. Along with its many Picassos, you can marvel at a mind-bending Salvador Dal\u00ed or boldly colored Joan Mir\u00f3. It\u2019s also an opportunity to discover some fantastic lesser-known Spanish artists. 3. Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum This extraordinary museum has impressive works from almost every movement of Western art, from 13th-century Italian Gothic to 20th-century pop art. With the personal collection of Swiss industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his father, you\u2019ll be dazzled by the fantastic breadth of art on show. 4. Royal Palace of Madrid On the former site of a Moor fortress dating back to the 9th century, Felipe V, the first Bourbon King, decided to build a palace more magnificent than all its European counterparts,s. While he died before his vision was complete, the palace is still an immense and opulent masterpiece, well worth a visit. 5. Tapas It would be almost a sin to leave without trying the small dishes for which the country is famed: Spanish tapas. Treat yourself to these bite-sized morsels at any number of bustling bars and markets such as the Mercado de San Miguel. You\u2019ll quickly become addicted to the jam\u00f3n, tortilla, and patatas bravas. 6. Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium Football fanatics will want to visit this temple to their beloved sport, the home also to Real Madrid. A tour lets you glimpse the stadium\u2019s inner workings, from the dressing rooms to the player\u2019s tunnel and even the pitch. A game, instead, gives you the thrill of seeing it come alive with 80,000 screaming fans. Planning your Madrid visit When to go? Spring and Autumn are the best times to visit. The days are still lovely and long and the weather is mild; ideal conditions for strolling around town. In summer instead, the city is flooded by tourists and the heat can be scorching hot. Many locals also leave for a few weeks to go on vacation so some small local shops and cafes will be closed. Come winter (excluding the Christmas and New Year period) and the city gets quiet, which may be perfect for those wanting to avoid the crowds. It can get cold, but the temperatures rarely dip below freezing. Meanwhile, ticket prices and accommodations will be at the lowest, which for some more than make up for a bit of cold. How many days should you spend? Three days will be enough to scratch the surface and get a general feel for the city. If you have the time, five days or more will give you the opportunity to delve deeper and get into the swing of the Madrile\u00f1o way of life (i.e. late meals, siesta, and of course fiesta!). You\u2019ll be able to wander through Madrid\u2019s charming neighborhoods, go out till all hours enjoying the famed nightlife, sample any number of local delicacies, and even fit in a day trip to Toledo, Segovia, or \u00c1vila. How to get there? The Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport (officially the Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport) is the city\u2019s international airport. It also happens to be the country\u2019s busiest and most impressive. From here it\u2019s an easy train ride to the center. Trains leave every 5 minutes from 6:05 am to 1:30 am; tickets cost \u20ac5. Otherwise, you can also take the 24-hour express bus service (\u20ac5) or a taxi for a fixed price of \u20ac30. How to move around the city? Madrid has an extensive and easy-to-use public transport system. Tickets cost \u20ac1.50 for a single trip; a 10-trip ticket costs \u20ac12.20 and is a good deal for a short stay. The metro is the most convenient way to get around and runs from 6:05 am to 1:30 am. The bus also comes in handy, but with over 200 routes it\u2019s a tad more complicated for first-time users; it runs from 6:30 am to 11:30 pm. Taxis are relatively easy to find and comparatively cheaper than those in other European capitals. Biking is also an option with several bike-share services and a decent number of central bike lanes. Otherwise, you can walk to most places in central Madrid as it\u2019s fairly compact, although hillier than it seems! Where to shop? This bustling city has no shortage of excellent shopping options that go from luxury to the locally designed. Gran Via is the place for big commercial brands, such as H&M and Zara; it\u2019s also home to the gorgeous outpost of iconic Spanish brand Loewe. Instead, high-flyers will want to head to Calle Serrano, in the expensive Salamanca neighborhood. Here you\u2019ll find high fashion brands, such as Louis Vuitton or Manolo Blahnik, in the most elegant surroundings. Those looking for something more alternative should head to Calle Fuencarral in the hip Malasa\u00f1a. It has an unusual mix of high-end, street, emerging, and vintage fashion. And don\u2019t forget to make a stop at El Rastro, the city\u2019s lively open-air market.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in Berlin This freewheeling city is as famous for its vibrant art scene and non-stop clubbing as it is for the powerful sense of history that greets you at every turn. Berlin has been the center of the Prussian Kingdom, the German Empire and the headquarter of the Nazis. It\u2019s revolted, been bombed, divided, and reunited. Now it\u2019s a multicultural hub bursting with start-ups, creative spaces and cultural centers. It\u2019s a city that caters to all tastes, from clubbers to culture vultures and history buffs. With so much to offer, we wanted to share our top picks with you. From the artistic treasures of its Museum Island to its infamous Wall and historic Brandenburg Gate, the city is bound to intrigue and inspire you. 1. Museum Island On a small island in the Spree River lies this fascinating museum complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Made up of five grand state museums, highlights include the awe-inspiring Ishtar Gate from Babylon on display at the Pergamon Museum, and the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti at the Neues Museum. 2. Berlin Wall Only fragments remain of this once powerful symbol of the Cold War, the most significant being the Berlin Wall History Mile with its informative panels and the boldly decorated East Side Gallery. The latter showcases the work of over 100 artists, who transformed the grim remains into a monument to freedom. 3. Brandenburg Gate This famed landmark has played an essential role in German history. Taking pride of place in Prussian Berlin, it was later a Cold War symbol of division before becoming the emblem of unification and freedom we know today. Marvel at its history as well as its neoclassical design inspired by Athens\u2019 Acropolis. 4. Reichstag This iconic building has seen its fair share of action. It housed the Imperial Diet until 1933, then was set on fire and fell into disuse, before being restored after German reunification to again house the German parliament. Don\u2019t forget to head to its glossy glass dome for enchanting 360-degree city views. 5. DDR Museum Learn about daily life under the oppressive DDR in this absorbing interactive museum. Not only will you visit a recreated kitchen and a claustrophobic interrogation room, but you\u2019ll also get to go for a virtual spin in a Trabi, the standard car for East Germans often referred to as the \u2018worst car ever built\u2019. 6. Boat trip on the SpreeMeandering through the heart of Berlin, the Spree River is one of the city\u2019s most underrated attractions. A riverboat trip offers you an alternative view of some of the capital\u2019s top sights such as the Reichstag, Berlin Cathedral, Museum Island, and even the Fernsehturm TV tower and Neue Synagogue.Planning your Berlin visit When to go? For many, the ideal time to visit Berlin is from May to June and September to October. The weather is pleasantly mild, and you can enjoy sitting in buzzing outdoor cafes and beer gardens, strolling through its many parks, and even going for a breezy bike ride. While this is also possible in July and August, they\u2019re also the busiest months and the wettest (so come prepared with wet gear). For the unaccustomed winter in Berlin can seem uninviting, with grey days and temperatures hovering close to freezing. That said, it can be a good time to find a deal on airfares and hotel rates. How many days should you spend? At a stretch, you might be able to cram the city\u2019s best into one day, but we wouldn\u2019t advise it unless you\u2019re particularly short of time. Three days at a leisurely pace will most likely allow you to scratch the city\u2019s surface, but five days or more will give you a better chance of really getting to know the city. Not only will you be able to see the sights, but you\u2019ll also get to indulge in more local experiences, like a bike ride along the River Spree or a club night in Kreuzberg. How to get there? Berlin Brandenburg opened in October 2020 and is now the city's only airport. The Tegel Airport has permanently closed while the Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport was incorporated into the Brandenburg airport. The easiest way to get from the airport to the city center is by train. To get to Berlin Central station, it takes around 30-35 minutes and costs \u20ac3.60 one way. For the same price, you can also take a bus; it will take you around 20 minutes to get to Rudrow metro station. A cab ride from the airport to the center costs around \u20ac50. How to move around the city? Berlin has an extensive public transport system, which makes getting around relatively easy. The U-Bahn (subway) is the fastest and most convenient mode of transport. It runs from 4:30 am to 12:30 am Sunday to Thursday, and 24\/7 on Fridays and Saturdays. The S-Bahn (light rail) has the same hours but is less frequent and with fewer stops; it\u2019s best used for covering longer distances. Buses tend to be slower and less reliable but also cheaper. They have similar hours to the trains but with the advantage of half-hourly night buses after 12:30 am. Trams are also available but only in the eastern districts. Berlin is also well set up for cycling with many bike lanes and rental shops. Where to shop? The most famous of the city\u2019s shopping streets is without a doubt the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (aka \u2018Ku\u2019damm\u2019 to locals). Often referred to as the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Berlin, this sleek boulevard is packed with high-fashion brands such as Armani, Chanel, and Yves Saint Laurent. Those looking for hip independent boutiques instead should head to Hackescher Markt, an area that brims with old-school Berlin charm. Don\u2019t forget to stop at Hackesche H\u00f6fe to admire its Art Nouveau-style courtyards filled with chic shops offering everything from food to fashion. Berlin also loves its many street markets where you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of pre-loved goods. We recommend the weekend flea markets on Boxhagener Platz and Fehrbelliner Platz.",

There is the futuristic character of Potsdamer Platz, which contrasts with the Soviet memories of the enormous Alexanderplatz with its TV Tower.Do not miss the delightful inner courtyards of Hackescher Hofe, home to boutiques and trendy bars, and a walk to the East Side Gallery, the remnants of the Berlin Wall, now transformed in paintings by artists from all over the world. The Brandenburg Gate is also a must-see: It once divided the city into two while today it is the symbol of German unity. Art lovers will be happy with a visit to Museum Island and the Kulturforum. For your visit's grand finale you'll need to taste, finally, the currywurst, the typical and savoury street food of Berlin.",

A cultural center with a glorious past, Prague, heart of the Czech Republic, was the capital of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire. Today, with six million visitors a year, it is the most popular destination among tourists in Eastern Europe. It is not surprising the fact that it boasts of one of the most variegated collections of world architecture, from Art Nouveau to Baroque, from Cubism to Gothic, from Neo-classical to Ultramodern. A tour of the city can only start from the historic center with its narrow streets, a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1992. At its heart is the Old Town Square, surrounded by magnificent buildings, cafes, shops and galleries. Dominating the square are the Gothic spires of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Here we also find the Old Town Hall, characterized by colorful Gothic and Renaissance buildings and a tower which offers a picturesque view of the city. At the base of the tower there is a lovely astronomical clock, built in 1400 by master clockmaker Hanus.Founded in the ninth century, the Prague Castle is the national symbol of the Czech Republic, a cultural center and political power for centuries. This mighty monumental complex, consisting of church and residential buildings, fortifications and offices, was originally the residence of princes and kings of Bohemia; since 1918 it has been the seat of the President of the Republic. The area of the castle is dominated by the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, the largest and most magnificent church in Prague.Take a stroll in Golden Lane with its picturesque houses, home to alchemists before and goldsmiths later, but also to Franz Kafka, the most illustrious son of Prague and famous writer. Inevitable stop is to admire the romantic Charles Bridge, a stone bridge in the Gothic style that connects the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, commissioned by Charles IV in 1357 and designed by the architect Petr Parler. On the other hand, the symbol of modern Prague is the sinuous Dancing House, designed in the nineties by the architect Frank O. Gehry and inspired by the famous pair of dancers Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.",

The same past that has been converted into a present full of cultural and intellectual depth. The time of the Savoy seems like it was long ago but you can feel it by walking from Piazza Castello to the Piazza Reale, where the Palazzo Reale, built in the XVII century, stands proudly after being the Savoy residence for 200 years.Not far from the Lodge Armory, you get to the Royal Armory, one of the most important in Europe because of its rich and varied collection of weapons and armors. In the north-east part of the center, La Mole stands with grandeur. The emblem of Turin houses today the National Museum of Cinema. Just outside the center you can find the second symbol of Savoy capital, the Basilica di Superga, designed by Filippo Juvarra and wanted by Vittorio Amedeo II in 1706.The Turin Cathedral, dating to the period between 1491 and 1498, stands in the same place where a XIV century basilica was founded in the past. This is the only testimony of Renaissance art in the city. Furthermore, the cathedral is the guardian of the most discussed Christian relic of all times: the Holy Shroud.Going beyond the Porta Palatina you get to the Porta Palazzo. Here the largest market in Europe is held with an extraordinary maze of stalls and the intrigue of multi-ethnic tastes and smells of incredible charm. A little farther on, in the neighborhood of Borgo Dora, you can come across in a lively and ancient flea market, known as the \"Balon\".Found between Piazza Castello and Piazza Carlo Felice, Piazza San Carlo is known as the 'living room of Turin' thanks to its extraordinary elegance. Among the baroque facades of the twin churches San Carlo and Santa Cristina, luxurious bars and chic boutiques follow one another, while in the center of the square you can admire the famous equestrian statue Caval d' Br\u00f4ns, dedicated to Emanuele Filiberto.A few steps from Piazza San Carlo, you can visit the famous Egyptian Museum, one of the most important after the Museum of Cairo.

Quang Nam has served as an international trade hub for centuries, commonly exporting luxury goods such as silk, fabrics, paper, porcelain, and more.

The city\u2019s well-preserved historic district is picturesque, with a majority of the traditional and colonial buildings painted in a characteristic yellow. We recommend visiting the Chua Cau Temple Bridge (also commonly called the Japanese Bridge) as well as the Hoi An Night Market held in front of it each evening.Seek serenity at the My Son SanctuaryThe My Son Sanctuary is an extensive and unique temple complex that is said to have been the spiritual centre of the ancient Champa empire. While the My Son Sanctuary was bombed during the Vietnam War, the fascinating temple ruins still remain to this day and have been designed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with great cultural significance.Go for a dip at the Cham IslandsFor those seeking rest and relaxation, the Cham Islands have you covered. This cluster of eight islands is located 16 kilometres from the coast in the East Vietnam Sea. Embark on an excursion to the Cham Islands to lay on one of the pristine beaches or enjoy a variety of water activities such as swimming, snorkeling, diving, boat tours, and more.",
